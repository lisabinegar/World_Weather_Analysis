# World_Weather_Analysis

## Module 6 Challenge has been uploaded and includes the following items: 

- Weather_Database folder, containing a code file and a weather database CSV file. Weather data was pulled using an API call and made into a DataFrame which was then converted to a CSV file.  
- Vacation_Search folder, containing a code file, a CSV file, and a vacation weather map created using Pandas. Code was written to locate possible vacation spots using maximum and minimum temperature preferences as guide points to generate a list of cities and countries, as well as hotels. A DataFrame was created of these locations and exported to a CSV file. A marker map was generated with pop-up markers for the cities in the vacation DataFrame. 
- Vacation_Itinerary folder, containing a code file and two images created to capture maps made using API and gaps. Four cities were chosen for a vacation itinerary, and four DataFrames were created that were merged into one DataFrame. A directions layer map as well as a marker layer map with pop-up markers for the cities in the itinerary were created.
